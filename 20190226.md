#### 1. Login to docker.hub

Q & A: 
1. what is docker registry?
--> to host docker image
2. what is docker.hub ?
--> official docker registry, maintained by Docker

#### 2. Assuming we have an image (identity: 'iname:itag'), now use it

Create a Container from the image.

```bash
# This will create a Container for a specific image.
# If the image is not already downloaded, Docker will first pull it from registry.
# Created Container will be at status of "Created"

# grammar: docker create [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]

# 1. Minimum docker create
docker create iname:itag

# 2. Create Container from image and give it a name. Note that options for container name should go before the image name.
docker create --name name iname:itag

# Common options

# --tty , -t : Allocate a pseudo-TTY
# --interactive , -i : Keep STDIN open even if not attached

docker create --name name -t -i iname:itag
```
